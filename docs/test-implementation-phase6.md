# Test Implementation Plan - Phase 6

With coverage now around 39%, we continue pushing toward the 50% threshold. This phase builds on previous efforts with targeted API route tests and expanded component coverage.

## Objectives

- Raise overall test coverage above 45%.
- Address remaining gaps in solo API routes and core components.
- Prepare for more comprehensive E2E scenarios in the next phase.

## Target Areas

1. **Solo API Routes**
   - Complete coverage for `/solo/[gameId]/score`, `/solo/[gameId]/reach`, and `/solo/[gameId]/result`.
2. **Components without Tests**
   - Add tests for `LoadingSpinner`, `MenuDrawer`, and `GameEndScreen` interactions.
3. **Context and Hooks**
   - Extend `AuthContext` tests for edge cases like token refresh failures.
   - Cover additional behaviors in `usePerformanceMonitor`.
4. **Playwright Flows**
   - Start outlining multi-step flows (room creation -> game start -> scoring).

## Timeline

- **Week 16**: Solo route tests and component coverage.
- **Week 17**: Context and hook edge cases.
- **Week 18**: Initial Playwright flows and wrap-up.

Coverage results will be reviewed after each milestone to ensure continued progress toward 50% and beyond.

## Implementation Notes

- Added tests covering solo reach and result API routes
- Verified GameEndScreen countdown and button interactions
- Extended AuthContext refresh error handling test
- Expanded usePerformanceMonitor with disabled case assertion
- Created a basic Playwright scenario for room creation to game start
