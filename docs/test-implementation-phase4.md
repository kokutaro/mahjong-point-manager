# Test Implementation Plan - Phase 4

With test coverage now around 36%, we aim to push beyond the 50% milestone. This phase will extend testing to additional APIs, hooks, and components while refining existing tests.

## Objectives

- Increase overall coverage toward 50%+.
- Expand coverage of lower tested APIs and UI pages.
- Add regression tests for recently introduced logic.

## Target Areas

1. **app/api/game/[gameId]/vote-session**
   - Cover vote start, progress tracking, and error responses.
2. **app/api/solo/[gameId]/score**
   - Validate solo scoring updates and end-of-game handling.
3. **components/GameResult.tsx**
   - Ensure final score rendering and rematch controls behave correctly.
4. **components/MenuDrawer.tsx**
   - Test open/close interactions and navigation links.
5. **hooks/useSocket.ts** (additional scenarios)
   - Simulate reconnection logic and event unsubscription.

## Timeline

- **Week 10**: Add API tests for vote-session and solo score routes.
- **Week 11**: Implement UI tests for GameResult and MenuDrawer.
- **Week 12**: Extend useSocket tests and refactor mocks.

Progress will be reviewed weekly with coverage reports until we surpass the 50% mark.
